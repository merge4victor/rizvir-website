description: This is a Nagios/Icinga plugin that queries your Amazon's CloudWatch metrics and compares them with your given thresholds. Why use this instead of CloudWatch Alarms? Well, other than not costing $0.10 per check after exceeding your free-tier, it allows you to retain your Nagios/Icinga/Centreon on-call and notification setup while still benefiting from CloudWatch metrics.
