description: Imagine if allowing incoming FTP connections to your ftp server with iptables was as easy as having a file containing the line "server ftp accept". Or if only allowing outgoing HTTP access by Apache to just your LAN just needed a line saying "client http accept user apache dst 10.1.2.0/24". Or imagine if you could just preview your firewall rules for 30 seconds before commiting them, saving yourself from being locked out with a bad rule? Stop dreaming, and start installing FireHOL on your servers.
