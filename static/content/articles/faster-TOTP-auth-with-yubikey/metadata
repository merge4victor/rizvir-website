description: Using two factor with AWS or Paypal is a very good idea. However, both these services have an annoyance compared to other providers who use two factor authentication: AWS and Paypal _always_ ask for your 6-digit token before you can log in, unlike say Google where it wouldn't ask for your OTP for the same device.  However, you can use a Yubikey to ease some of the pain, and have a shortcut enter the token when your Yubikey is plugged in.
