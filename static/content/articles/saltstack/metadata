description: This talks about setting Salt, which is a wonderful configuration management system written in Python that I find easier to work with than Puppet, and has one advantage over Ansible. There are many Salt tutorials, but this one is geared towards a more small-production setup in a way that makes it easy to add specific entries for certain hosts. It is not for designed for absolute beginners.
